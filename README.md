Challenge 1: Collatz Conjecture - This was my first time hearing of the Collatz Conjecture. The user inputs a starting number. While the number is not 1: If it's even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Each step is counted and printed as part of the sequence. I used a while loop because the number of iterations isn't known ahead of time — it depends on how the sequence progresses.
Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker - The program checks if a given number is prime. If the number is ≤ 1, it's not prime. Otherwise, a for loop tests divisibility from 2 up to (but not including) the number itself. If the number is divisible by any of those values, it's not prime. If no divisors are found, the number is prime. The for loop made it easy to go through a known range of numbers.
Challenge 3: Multiplication Table - This prints a clean, formatted multiplication table from 1 to 10: The outer for loop handles the rows. The inner for loop handles the columns. I used f-strings to keep the output aligned and readable. I had some starter code for this from Word, which I adapted and improved with nested loops.
AI Assistance - Big thanks to ChatGPT, it helped me understand the Collatz sequence and gave me guidance on structuring the prime check and formatting the multiplication table. I didn’t just copy-paste though — I made sure I understood and modified the code myself.
